Milestone 2: Give a demo of your component. (15 points for CS1631)

    The demo is similar to the demo you give at the first milestone, except that the details of the application of your component should be
    demonstrated.

    If you have not successfully implemented the Input Processor to transform incoming phone call into CastVote message 701, you
    can still use the remote control to give the demo following the phone to PC scenario.

    You should pre-store the messages (as XML documents) so that you can do the demo quickly.

    You can also instantiate more than one remote control in your demo, in case you need them.

    The grading is 10 points for successful demo, 2 points for voter usability, 2 points for administrator usability
    and 1 point for security.


Rehearsal: (bonus points) If your group have successfully implemented the InputProcessor and VotingSoftware Components
(or a combined component) for the Android app, you will be rehearsing to deal with the real voting events on CSDay.


1.  Voter can send email from his/her smart phone to a specific PC running voting softwareX (Linux version).

2.  Upon receipt of the email containing the ID number of the best poster (only one should be selected), the said ID number will
    be entered in a TallyTable with attributes CandidateID, count.

3.  The phone number of the voter will be remembered in a VoterTable with attributes VoterPhoneNo, CandidateID, so that no voter
    can use the same phone to vote twice.

4.  The administrator at the PC running voting softwareX can issue a special command, which will terminate the voting.

    4a. The voting softwareX will display the TallyTable in decreasing number of votes so that the first winner will be displayed first
        and so on.

    4b. At the end the VoterTable will be eliminated.


Hashmap<string, int> tallyTable = new Hashmap<string, int>();
Hashmap<string, boolean> voterTable = new Hashmap<string, boolean>();

if (!voterTable[incomingVote.email]) { // new voter
    if (tallyTable[incomVote.id]){
        tallyTable[incomVote]++;
    } else {
        tallyTable.add(incomVote.id, 1)
    }
    voterTable.add(incomingVote.email, true)
}
